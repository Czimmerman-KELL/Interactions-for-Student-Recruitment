## Roadmap

This section should outline the roadmap for the Interactions for Student Recruitment as it pertains to the University of Miami's vision for this project outside of it's currently delivered state.

Considerations surrounding Phase 2, Phase 3, etc. should be included. Specifically the roadmap should help drive open source contributions that support a vision for the future state of this project.

All project roles should work together to determine the best opportunities for the improvement of the project. This should produce direction for the project, which should be highlighted in the Roadmap.

As a project role does not necessarily control resources other than their own labor, they should encourage contributors to participate in furthering development of the project toward the goals of the Roadmap.
